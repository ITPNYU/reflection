Simulacra API

Simulacra is a web API (application programming interface) that models the 
types of things we care about. The data interchange format of choice is 
JSON, and the API mechanisms are ReSTful. Front-end (i.e. HTML/JavaScript) 
interfaces using this API should probably live in separate repos.
